A cheat sheet I am
This is my cheat sheet
I contain all of your secrets
echo is for repeating things, cat is for reading text files
VSCode is a text editor
"ls" lists all of the files in a foler
"cd ~" change directory to home folder
"cd .." sends you back up one level in the directory
"mkdir" creates a folder or document or location or whatever
"pwd" tells you where you're located in the directory (ex. Users/August/Documents)
">>" sends text to the thing you tell it to
crtl+C will get it back to normal if you crash the terminal and there's no dollar sign
"wc -w" word count
"wc -l" line count
crtl button with a letter or series of letters will give you options to quickly and acccurately give you possible commands
"-m" on git leaves a note where you can describe what changes have been made. (ex. added something, date of changes, who changed it)
"git add" pay attention to the document
"git commit" saves that version within the whole files
save on VScode, git add _____, git commit (plus a -m "" note about what changes were made), git push origin master. Then it should be in the repository online when you're done.
